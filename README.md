# gamequest
 A simple game made with SDL2 in C++.

Proof of concept bullet hell made to test the Simple DirectMedia Layer library. Fully functional with one type of enemy and a game over condition (however without a win one, for realistic purposes).

Compiled executable should work on x86 processors, otherwise all source code is inside sdl2sdl2.
